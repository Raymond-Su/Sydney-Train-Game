# Sydney Train Game

This was an attempt to solve the Sydney Train Game

## The Puzzle

Living in Sydney it is inevitable that I travel via the public transport system, after all the highways are so congested that there is no other option unless you’re in a position to pay exorbitant housing prices, but that’s another story. On the Sydney trains, each carriage has a unique 4 digit number, usually preceded by some letter, printed up on the interior wall. They look like this:

A Sydney Train Carriage Number
It has been a reoccurring game amongst my friends over the past few years that whenever we are on a train we need to try to make 10 using the carriage number. Furthermore, I believe this game is known amongst many Sydneysiders and hence I decided to write about it. The rules are simple though there are a few variations:

- Using common mathematical operations make 10 using the individual digits from left to right.
- Using common mathematical operations make 10 using the individual digits in any order you like.

For example, the carriage number might be 5432, ignoring the prepended letter. An appropriate solution might be 5 + 4 + 3 – 2 = 10.
